# Explainable-Histopathology-Classification-ViT
This repository proposes a ViT-based approach for histopathological image classifications that leverages ViT attention to highlight crucial image regions in the decision-making process. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for our experimental activity is publicly available at: [https://gitee.com/neuhwm/GasHisSDB.git](https://gitee.com/neuhwm/GasHisSDB.git)
It contains MRI scans of 110 patients with lower-grade glioma with the relative segmentation mask annotated by medical personnel.
